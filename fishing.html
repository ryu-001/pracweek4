        <br>
        <p class="fishing-paragraph">Seafood plays an essential role in feeding the worlds growing population, 
            with 17% of meat consumption being fish products. Due to historical overfishing and climate change
            over half of golabl fisheries are in decline or overexploited which poses a threat to global food demand.
            Today, many fisheries are working on rebuilding previously overfished species such as the blue fin tuna
            and atlantic cod. This rebuild has utilised artificial intelligence methods and robotics in order to asses 
            and track population regrowth and help with resource management and decision making. These computer programs help
            goverments make decisions on fishing quotas, which is especially useful in many developing countries who do not have
            much or in most cases any previous data or research in fisheries. The application of computer science to this
            field has made it easier to enfornce sustainable fishing measures. It is estimated that fishers' incomes could 
            be 10 times higher if fishing populations were well managed which provides an incetive to implement the technology
            and revert the environmental damage that has been caused.

        <br>
        <p class="fishing-paragraph">
            Recreational fishing is a relaxing and satisfying hobby enjoyed by many. Applications of computer science to the
            sport have allowed both beginner and advanced fisherpeople to further their interest in their passtime and has made 
            fishing much more accessable. Software innovations such as fishbrain (the most popular fishing app on the apple app store)
            have improved the efficiency in the activity. These apps allow for collection and analysys of important data, such 
            as successful catches using particular bait, best bite times and how species of fish react to weather condtions and provides
            predictions and recomendations of the best times and locations to  fish in the coming week. This takes out much of the mundaness
            associated with the activity of sitting around and nothing happening and has lead to the increase of catches of fish by hobbyists.
            As well as this, the spread of information has allowed for a new generation of fisherpeople to learn the sport. Previously,techniques
            had to be passed down, limiting the number of people interested in fishing to actually take it up. Social media has lead to the ability
            to find fishing groups, instructors and self teach, thus improving the quality of peoples fishing and therefore the enjoyment of the hobby.
